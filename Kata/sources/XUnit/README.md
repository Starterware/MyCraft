# XUnit

This kata is taken from more the fascinating book __"Test driven development by example"__ by Kent Beck.
The goal of this kata is to create your own testing framework: 
being able to print a report of the successes and failures of test methods and test classes that were given to a test suite.
The interesting part is that you use what you implemented directly after implementing it (like a bootstrapping process).
