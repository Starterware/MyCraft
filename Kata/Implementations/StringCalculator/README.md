#Kata: String Calculator [[Main]](https://github.com/Starterware/MyCraft) [[Parent]](../README.md)

##Description:

1. Create a simple string calculator method:
	* It can take 0, 1 or 2 numbers, and will return their sum (for an empty string it will return 0)
	* Ex: "" or "1" or "1,2"
	
2. Allow the method to handle an unknown amount of numbers

3. Allow the method to handle new lines between numbers (instead of commas)

4. Support different delimiters

5. Calling the method with a negative number will throw an exception
